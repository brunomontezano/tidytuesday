# TidyTuesday

- The objective of this repository is to keep TidyTuesday scripts made by me.

- *Tidy Tuesday* is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem.
It aims to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`,
`dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem. 

- The scripts are present in their respective month/year directory.
